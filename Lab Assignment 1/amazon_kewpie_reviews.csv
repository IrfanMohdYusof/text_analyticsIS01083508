Laura Whitley,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2024","I got turned onto this years ago at sushi bars and it tastes so similar to my own. pretty pricey at grocery stores per bottle so I looked on amazon. 6 bottles is not to much, pantry safe till opened & the fact that it's in a squirt bottle is so much better than watching people lick the knife & put it directly back into a jar. also, if you want to customize with garlic juice, mustard, sriracha or some wasabi go for it. you just can't do it when it's full, let it go down by about a 1/4. that's all."
Desirae Le,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2024",Love this stuff! So good. I used it to make japanese potato salad and to top my okonomiyaki. It was delicious!

AFMerc,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2024","I recently purchased the Kewpie Squeeze Mayonnaise, and I must say, it has completely transformed my mayo game. The squeeze bottle design is not only convenient but also ensures that I can effortlessly add just the right amount to my sandwiches, burgers, and salads without any mess. The 12-ounce size strikes the perfect balance between having enough to last but without taking up too much space in my fridge.

The flavor of this mayo is exceptional. It's rich, creamy, and has a unique taste that sets it apart from other mayonnaises. What's even better is that it's gluten-free, catering to those with dietary restrictions without compromising on taste. The Kewpie brand has truly delivered a mayonnaise that excels in both convenience and flavor. I highly recommend the Kewpie Squeeze Mayonnaise to anyone looking to elevate their culinary experience – it's a 5-star product that has earned a permanent spot in my kitchen!"
Stevie Holland,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2024","The best way I could describe this to someone who has never tasted it before, is that it tastes like a very tangy mayonnaise lol. Like it has horseradish kind of twang. Ive only tried a taste of it off of my finger, and not on any food, but it isn't an awful taste, but definitely has an acquired taste"
PhxAvidReader1,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2023","I'm not big on mayo, but I kept seeing this product alongside items like ""Better than Bullion"" and ""Kerrygold Butter"" in yearly lists of upgrades worth the price.

One tuna sandwich was all it took to sell me on this, despite the fact that I used it sparingly.

It costs a bit more, so I save it for dishes and dips where I expect to taste the mayo.

I hope you enjoy it."
Benjamin Hosfeld,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2025",Received a a bottle that was expired in November of last year.
California customer,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2024",I have seen this many times on cooking shows and I have been curious to try it. A definite fan. Better texture and great flavor.
Autoworker,"Reviewed in Canada on October 8, 2024","Fantastic flavour, The best yet for any mayonnaise we have ever tried and the only one we use now. Weird packaging with a soft squeeze bottle but it actually works quite well. If you havent tried this Kewpie Mayo just buy it and then throw your other mayo away because you most likey will be as shocked as us at just how tasty this is."
Arvi C.,"Reviewed in Canada on January 14, 2025","Was so disappointed. The oil is split and I did my best to shake it, I even blended it but it’s all watery and soupy and not a mayo consistency anymore even after blending. Don’t buy!"
Elven,"Reviewed in Canada on October 13, 2024","LOL I saw this mayo on a video, thought I would give it a try, I LOVE THIS STUFF, I put it on practically everything.....It really has a unique taste that outshines all other mayos. It's especially fantastic on deviled eggs! GOODBYE regular mayo! I'm a Kewpie Mayo lover now!!!! Thank you!"
Valerie Gordon,"Reviewed in Canada on January 26, 2024",The only problem is that it splits in the bottle so when you get its and oily mess. I had to take it out of the squeeze bottle and remix it before refrigerating. I'm not sure it would always work so you'd have to try it for yourself.
Ila,"Reviewed in Canada on November 24, 2024","This is delicious, a bit more on the acid side, and you can definitely taste the difference from regular mayo. Delicious to make store ramen a bit more extra."
Vanessa,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024",Love this but too expensive
E.O.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2024",This was the right size for me and is definitely good value for money. The children also felt the taste was better than the previous brand we were using. Intend to purchase again.
obrss,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2024","Adds a delicious taste to homemade salad dressing. Mix with regular mayo and a touch of ranch dressing. If you want it sweeter add a tsp if sweet pickle juice. Add any spices like paprika, garlic powder, minimal s&p. Use your imagination!"
MM,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2024",At first this tasted a little likea Miracle Whip not strongly but a little. Im not a fan of miracle whip but upon refridgeration it has a totally unami taste. Different but I like it.
Kay,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2023",I like the taste of this. And love the squeeze bottle. I just had to try it after reading about it. Executive chefs love Kewpie Mayo. I did some more reading after I got this and turns out there are two versions. This is the American made one with yeast extract. There is a Japanese made version with MSG which gives it the umami flavor and that is what the top chefs actually use. Search “ japanese kewpie mayonnaise” on Amazon and it will come up. It has different packaging. It’s $18.89 for a two pack and I paid it because I have to try it (if you try to order direct from Kewpie it’s $19.99 for one bottle). Now I won’t have to buy Mayo for awhile…
Dancing Sprit,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023","This mayo has great flavor and texture but it is made in USA by the same company that makes it in Japan. The formula is different and there is no MSG because that is considered unhealthy here, although that now subject to question. It is good, but not so much better than Hellman's/Best Foods to justify the premium price. The real Japanese product is available at Amazon, but it is even more costly."
"The shirt I received has a black spot on the front, currently waiting on a reply from the seller but I don't have time to deal with returning the product unless they come pick it up. I'm sure I'll end up with a useless shirt in the end, we shall see...","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2024","Just what I needed to kick a burger up a notch, also good on fries. I'm going to send a bottle to a friend that got me hooked on fries with mayo. I use mayo for the fat needed to make grilled cheese sandwiches, going to try it out tonight."
Zanniegsp,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024",I don’t have any international stores near me and has been hard to find in stores. The flavor of this is so good on sandwiches. So glad I was able to get this on Amazon.
Rational Velvet,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2023","Nothing really wrong, it just was not something I would buy again. It just was not yummy/special enough to make me come back to it. Would not be a repeat buyer."
Bobbie M O’Brien,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024","I keep hearing how wonderful this mayonnaise is so I bought some with high expectations. I tried it and yeah it’s fine but it taste like mayonnaise with a tiny drop of lemon juice in it I don’t get all the hype I’m a big foodie with excellent taste buds and yeah it’s usable, but seriously save your money, it’s just like a little extra acidic mayonnaise"
Bamikole O.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2025",Sent me a mayo that expired in a month!
Nicole,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2018","Love this mayo! It's thicker than American mayo like Hellmann's. Japanese mayo is made with egg yolk instead of just egg white like typical American mayo that's why KewPie Mayo has a yellowish color and is thicker. It's also made with a different kind of vinegar instead of white vinegar. That also lends to a unique taste different than Hellmann's.

I originally used this for our tuna sushi burritos but you can use this for any dish that you use regular mayo in (deviled eggs, chicken or tuna salad, sandwiches, etc). If you like things spicy, you can make a spicy mayo by adding some sriracha sauce to it and giving it a stir.

I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to experience something different but not wildly different. You can tell it's mayo and the taste, while unique, it's not so different from what you're used to that you'll find it strange. Give it a try!

Update: I just used this when making my usual crab salad. I had reached for my Hellmann's but saw this in the door and thought, ""why not?"" the crab salad came out very good. I actually preferred this mayo to my usual because it added a bit more flavor and texture (since it's thicker than the usual brand)."
Joanne Saltman,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2024","Use this a lot in egg salad and others, great flavor enhancer"
KLDen,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2024","Great product even though it is made in California, not Japan. Price points here seem to be high for the 12oz bottle. I recommend looking for a 17.4oz bottle at about the same price point. Or, buy locally."
Robyn E. Brennan,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2024",You cant go wrong with this! Delivery was quick. We go through it pretty fast so I wish it were a bit more affordable but not having to drive extra far to get to our local asian market is a win. Will continue to purchase this as long as we can!
Patricia F.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2024","I decided to give this a try and loved it. Great flavor and a smooth rich consistency. I also love the container, it makes it easy to use all of the product right down to the last bit with very little waste. Highly recommend"
Susan Larkin,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024",It’s pretty expensive for something that taste like miracle whip
Christian K,"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024",Dangerously delicious and the large bottle is way sturdier than the smaller one.
Hayley Shaver author of Gaia's Beings,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2024",I love this mayo. I have had it in a tortilla with gochujang sauce and canned chicken and it's just delicious. It tastes lighter than regular mayo and that's a plus.
Diane G,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2024",I really want to love this mayonnaise. But the salt stood out and covered the taste of the mayo.
stephanie lynn jacobs,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024","Very versatile mayo, but really good on a hard boiled egg."
Mary C.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2022","I just love mayo. Hellman’s, since I’m too far north to find Duke’s in my itty-bitty grocery store. But I read a rave review in Bon Appetit Magazine and had to try Kewpie’s. The flavor was different and fine, but I can’t say definitely better than Hellman’s. However, for me the deal-breakers were 1) it’s more than 3 times as expensive for me than Hellman’s; and 2) I didn’t like the squeeze-bottle packaging. Even stored in the fridge upside down, I didn’t enjoy pounding it on the counter to coax forth the mayo. And when the spurting was finished, I just want that last tablespoon — or perhaps more? I don’t know how much was left in there of mayo in the bottle. However, to get it I would have had to slice open the plastic bottle. I’m much happier with my long-handled plastic scraper thingies and my Hellman’s."
Carol J Elvin,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2024",I bought this because I heard that it was “better” than plan my plane mayonnaise! No matter how much I shook this bottle I could not keep it from separating ! All that would come out was the “oil”. Very disappointing. I ended up just throwing it away. Waste of money..
Dlynn,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2023",Excellent Mayo choice for making spicy crap rolls at home.
Amy Will-Prellwitz,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024","Im not a fan of regular mayo, but this mayooooo!!!! Something about it is so delicious. I use this for my grilled cheeses, potato salad and always get rave reviews. Highly recommend."
Computer Lab Lady,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2024",I love this mayo. Taste great!!! Highly recommend!!
J. 5.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024","Cheapest I could find. Very good. Should be cheaper but hey it's Amazon.
Taste is excellent. Plowed through it."
Lona Musick,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2024",Always loved the stuff. No more being embarrassed to use it. Its Kewpie Nippon mayonnaise now.
Robin Conklin,"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2024","pretty much just reminds me of mirical whip, so if that not your jam this wont be lol"
Amarante,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2023","Historically I used Hellmans/Best but reading raves about Dukes and Kewpie I decided to give them a test run.

I really like Dukes - much more so than Hellmans/Best in any kind of recipe where the taste of the mayo is important like a BLT sandwich. Probably not important where it is a background ingredient though.

Kewpie I didn't like as much as Dukes or even Hellmans/Best. Maybe it is me but it seemed blander than those. I will finish off the very small bottle and go back to Dukes."
Video Games,"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024",good on sandwich
Barbara Johnston,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023","I absolutely love this mayo. It has mustard and vinegar with salt, sugar and other things to create a Super tangy flavor. I made tacos and it called for Kewpie mayo , so I ordered it. So glad I did. My friend had the taco and said it was the best thing she had ever tasted. I think a lot of it had to do with the Kewpie Mayonnaise!!"
paul molacek,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2023",To be fair I'm not the hugest mayo fan but I've seen this on social media so I wanted to give it a try. It's ok in my opinion but I'm sure others love it more. Not upset with it just not what I expected...
Isabel,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024",Works good on food.
Brandi,"Reviewed in the United States on May 12, 2024",First impression !better than american mayo😋😋😋
Misha,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2023","I had to purchase this brand in place of my regular (product of Japan), and I am very sad to say I was quite disappointed. The flavor was not the same. It was still okay (which is why I gave it 3 stars), and it served a great purpose when I needed it; however, even compared to my own home-made .... no. I won't be purchasing this one again unless it is all I can get. Sorry guys. I know you try hard, but it just falls short for me."
Jane Epstein,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2023",This mayo really makes a difference. I really do like it much better than the common supermarket brands. It is only found usually an Asian markets. So it is nice that it's available on Amazon.
Big T,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024",Tasty mayo. Versatile
Junkyarddawg,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2024",Fast ship but as Edgar Allen Poe said it best —- Nevermore
SevenGoats,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2023",I see so many reviews complaining about the price. #1 you agreed to the price when you purchased #2 the ingredients and lack of artificial ingredients are worth it. This is the BEST Mayo I’ve ever had. Delivered earlier than expected. Came in perfect condition; nicely packaged. If you want Dollar Tree Mayo this isn’t for you.
